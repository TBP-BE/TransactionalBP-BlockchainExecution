# TransactionalBP-BlockchainExecution

The present project is an extension to an existing tool named Caterpillar in order to support the execution of Transactional Business Processes.
We extended specifically the version 2.0 of Caterpillar where you can find the original source code at: https://github.com/orlenyslp/Caterpillar/tree/master/v2.0. 
We mainly brought modifications to the core of Caterpillar, here named TBP-BE-core.
The execution-panel which serves as user interface to interact with the core is the same.

For installing and using the core and the execution-panel, please follow instructions at: https://github.com/orlenyslp/Caterpillar
